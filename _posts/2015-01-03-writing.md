title: "Back to Writing"

It feels like forever since the last time I blogged. Which kind of is, given that I stopped updating [my personal blog][kaishinlab] since I joined thoughtbot in 2012. It was a mix of lacking the time to do proper research outside work hours and finding [better][robots] [venues][smashing] for technical writing.

In a way, I was trying to shift my focus from writing about the things that irk me on a daily basis to working towards fixing them. Actions speak louder than words, the mantra goes. As time went on, I started to realize that writing about something as way of getting it out of your system might have the highest effectiveness to time spent ratio, especially if it reaches a wider audience.

Speaking of audience, I was told that Medium is where it's at these days, making the social writing platform a compelling choice for casual writers like myself. Given how tiny my blog audience got over the last 3 years, I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. In the end, I decided against it; there is simply no way I would write on a closed platform.

This led me to the last decision I had to make before effectively going back to writing: resuming from where I left off or starting afresh. As I pondered about this, I came to the conclusion that it doesn't have to be black or white; it's nothing that a few redirects can't handle, and that is exactly the reason why I enjoy having total control over my data.
