Many of you have enjoyed my [previous article](http://kaishinlab.com/giving-design-feedback/) about giving design feedback, so here is a follow-up dealing with the issue from a designer perspective.



While our clients, bosses or peers might not always be able to communicate effectively their opinions about design, it is by no mean an excuse for us designers to put all the blame of a faulty communication on them. We are equally responsible, if not slightly more. 




Dealing with criticism can be daunting at times, but it's inherent to the design profession. Skipping it is not an option, botching it is.
Let's have a look at 5 things to avoid when getting design feedback:





## 1. Taking it personally




Do not take design criticism personally. Having your proposition rejected doesn't necessarily mean you are a bad designer. People have different tastes and opinions, so do not expect everyone to like what you do. Most importantly,  keep those critics tied to your design work, not your persona.





## 2. Ignoring feedback




Turning a deaf ear to what the others have to say just because you are a design professional is outright amateurish. Listen to others, and learn from them regardless of their status or profession.





## 3. Jumping to conclusions




Try to understand what's going on, but don't second guess. Ask specific questions, lots of them. Every bit of info can help you define the problem, which is halfway to finding a solution. Your client or boss may lack any design background to pinpoint the source of the problem; help them find their words through your questions.





## 4. Denying mistakes




No human being is perfect. Admit your mistakes and try to correct them, instead of denying them and blaming it on the others' ignorance. That's uncool.





## 5. Acting untactfully




You may often realize that the views expressed by others are too subjective and wouldn't necessarily serve the original purpose of your work. Try to explain that tactfully, using arguments and examples for better results. Remember that you are not here to tell people that they are wrong.
